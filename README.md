This repository contains the code accompanying our paper Enhanced Cross-Dataset Electroencephalogram-based Emotion Recognition using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation published in Computers in Biology and Medicine.
Our work presents a domain-adaptive deep network for EEG-based emotion classification, aiming to improve cross-domain model performance by addressing feature distribution discrepancies. We introduce a sample selection technique to reduce negative transfer and propose a cost-effective test-time augmentation method to enhance test performance.
